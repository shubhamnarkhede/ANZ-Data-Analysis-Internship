# ANZ Data Analysis Internship

Completed two modules in *Exploratory Data Analysis* and *Predictive Analytics* 
  Python libraries used - Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

TASK'S Details

Task 1 - 
  Segregation of customer data by each month using Pandas and Visualisation of transaction volume and mean amount of each day using 
 Matplotlib. Visualised mean payment amount by age and mean customer balance, with gender means included, for each month in data set.
   
Task 2 -
  Used Pandas to evaluate mean customer annual salary and then grouped customer data by customer id and mean. 
  Used Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms in Python. 
  Used two models Linear regression model and Decision tree classifier and regression models.
  Linear regression model - used card present flag, merchant code, balance, age and amount from grouped data set to predict annual salary,
  obtained test prediction accuracy of -0.32. Reverting back to original data set, created dummy variables for categorical variables 
  including gender and age. 
  Decision tree classifier and regression models - used modified data set to predict annual salary, obtained test scores of 0.76 and 0.67 
  respectively.
